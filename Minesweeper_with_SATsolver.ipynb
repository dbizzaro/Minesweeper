This is because the only constrain we have on the positions of the mines among the free cell is on the total cardinality, and, fixed that, any disposition is equally likely. This mean that assuming to have exactly $k$ mines among the $n$ free cells, the possible dispositions are simply $\\binom{n}{k}$. Therefore, any model for the bounded cells leaving out exactly $k$ mines to be on the free cells gives rise to exactly  $\\binom{n}{k}$ different general models. This reduces a lot the enumerations of models we need to perform. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the end, first we consider the number of models not having a mine on the first free cell (if there exists one). It should be clear from our discussion that this is equal to the number of models not having a mine on any other specific free cell, so that is why we consider just the first free cell. Again from the previous discussion it follows that such number of models is\n",

        "Then, we cycle through the bounded cells, and for each one we compute in a similar way the number of models not having a mine in that position, which is\n",

        "**Note**: the function *enum_models* that we are using is built in a way that in order not to find out again a model already found, it negates each model it finds, before looking for another. Therefore, since we do not want exclude permanently those models from possible subsequent calls of the satsolver, we introduce a new auxiliary variable specific for each call of *enum_models*: each call will look for models in which the auxiliary variable is True, and when it is done the variable is forever set to False.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note2**: Commented there is some code that computes the number of models by simple enumeration, without using our trick. I used it to check that the function calculated the right numbers of models, and you can de-comment and use it for the same purpose. Notice however that it would be highly inefficient to keep it and not use our trick."
